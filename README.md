# ETL_Project

For this project we have decided to look at web streaming services and compare all of their databases and see which ones had what movies. That way someone can look and see what movies or shows is on what streaming service in one place. The streaming services we used are Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. Below are the steps we took to complete the project.

     1.	Downloaded our datasets from Kaggle.
     2.	Imported the csv files into pandas and created the data frames.
     3.	Joined the data frames on the title index.
     4.	Imported sqlalchemy and set up our engine.con.
     5.	Finally, we uploaded our master data frame into the movies table.
